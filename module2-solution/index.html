<div class="container">
<div class="row">
    <div id="box" class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p>Venus is the second planet from the sun and is the hottest planet in the solar system. Its thick atmosphere is extremely toxic and composed of sulfuric acid clouds, the planet is an extreme example of the greenhouse effect.

    <div id="box" class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is a cold, desert-like planet covered in iron oxide dust. Mars shares similarities with Earth: It is rocky, has mountains, valleys and canyons, and storm systems ranging from localized tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms.

    <div id="box" class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and is famous for its large and distinct ring system. Though Saturn is not the only planet in the solar system with rings.
